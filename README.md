  * The Kieso, Weygandt, Warfield, Young, Wiecek, McConomy: Intermediate Accounting text has an outstanding reputation as "THE" text for the course and is viewed as a reliable resource by accounting students, faculty and professionals. After listening carefully to instructors and students alike, and after having built on what we have learned over nine successful editions and more than 28 years of being the market leader, we are confident that the tenth edition will continue to meet the needs of instructors and students.
 
  * The integration of the new International Accounting Standards and their comparison with Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises enhances the main goal of the book, “to help students understand, prepare and use financial information by linking education with the 'real-world’ accounting environment". Our industry-experienced and leading-edge author expertise in the field of IFRS, combined with an update of the text's technical content ensures that accounting faculty and students can continue to rely on Intermediate Accounting.
 
  * The authors continue their emphasis on helping students understand the core concepts that are at the heart of the accounting profession. The chapters are interesting, informative and pedagogically sound. Clear explanations of important issues, concepts and business transactions are provided, followed by examples of how these are applied in practice. Interesting examples show how the resulting numbers are used, and how "real life" Canadian companies actually account for and report their accounting transactions and results.
